## Mysterious Vendor - Jack
Every day from 12:00 there is a small chance for the vendor to appear on your Artificial Island to give free rewards, including:

- Red Nucleus
- Special Voucher
- Gold Nucleus
- Proof of Purchase
- various gear upgrades

The vendor will leave the island after 12 hours.

He only appears when you're very close to him in both the map and visible draw distance.

## Visitor settings

You can share Jack's gifts with others by clicking on the `visitor settings` button to the left of `Go`. Any other player with the right permissions can visit your island and get most of the rewards like gold nucleus. Only the red nucleus and red voucher are exclusive to the island owner, so can't be shared.
