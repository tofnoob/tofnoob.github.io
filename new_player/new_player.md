# New player
Welcome to the start of your journey in Tower of Fantasy! It's an open world MMORPG so is a bit more complicated than Hoyoverse games, but you'll soon get used to it and understand everything with the help of this guide and the community.

If you want to quickly get a video overview then I'd recommend watching Touch Me Not's 2024 guide on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2F5f_q9BVw).

For new players I'd recommend to:
- focus on the main story (use the **_skip_** button if you want) and do some exploration of the Worlds
- join an active crew
- get help from others to complete content that can be done in groups, like raids or bosses
- keep dimension low at first to make World exploration and combat easier
- choose **one** main weapon element that you like and stick to it (flame, frost, physical, volt)
- remember to collect weekly rewards from the `commissionary` and `crew` menu
- avoid being a dedicated healer early on, as you must have enough damage to clear some solo content
- spend gold and black nucleus as you wish, save red nucleus and dark crystals for new weapons when you're decently levelled and geared
- save **_at least 120 pulls_** for when you decide to pull for a limited weapon to get one copy (this gets reduced to around 110 later) [more detail]
- save purple and blue password keys that open chests from the first World (Aesperia) and use in the second World (Vera) to get Mira currency to open Mirroria gachapon machines
- only farm seriously for gear when you can get gold gear
- try out weapons from the training menu to see what you like before pulling for one

Remember that it will take some time to get strong in the game so don't worry about gear, weapons and combat score (CS) too much at first. Just use what you get and use what's fun. And if you really want to get strong faster then your only options are to grind more or swipe that credit card.

## Platform
The first thing to decide is which platform to play on. Players on PC and mobile (Android & iOS) play together, whilst those on Playstation are on their own.

## Server
On PC and mobile there have already been numerous server merges. This means that the only thing that matters is which region you pick i.e. America, Europe. So no matter which server you pick, you'll play with everyone registered in that region.

For Playstation I'm not sure what the current state of server merges is, but I'd expect it to follow a similar path.

## Main character
One you start the game you'll have to choose your main character (MC) which will be male or female. The choice doesn't affect the story so choose what you prefer.

## Story progress
When starting out you'll want to get through most of the main story, using the glorious `Skip` button where needed. This will help unlock many areas of the map.

You can also join various groups and teleport to them to unlock more areas faster.

Unlocking areas can be useful for accessing areas with limited time events.

## Story skips

If you're a new player then you may notice that the story jump around a bit, but this is intentional so that you can complete 25% of Vera to unlock the basic content like daily missions and vitality system.

If you've jumped from Aesperia (World 1) to Vera (World 2) and want to return to the Aesperia story, then in the main menu click on `Terminal`, `Missions`, `Memories`.

## XP boosters

New players will receive some large multiplier for gaining XP faster to catchup. Not verified but you'll likely see this in the System messages, which is where World chat is.

## Worlds (Starchart Overview)
As of version 4.2, there are 4 different Worlds (Starchart Overview). Each World has smaller sub areas which from the map view can be found "orbiting" the main World.

The Worlds in order of appearance are:
1. Aesperia
2. Vera
3. Domain 9
4. Network

## World dimension level
Open your map to see it.

## User Interface
It may sound silly to have a guide on the UI, but the menus are really something special in ToF that will confuse newcomers.
