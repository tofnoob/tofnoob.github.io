# New player
There are a number of things to do when getting started with Tower of Fantasy and it is a bit more complicated than typical Hoyoverse games to start with, but becomes second nature over time.

For new players I'd recommend to:
- get through most of the main story
- get help from others to complete content that can be done in groups
- choose **one** weapon element that you like and stick to it
- avoid being a dedicated healer early on, as you must have enough damage to clear some solo content
- not worry about gear and weapons too much at first, as it will take some time to get strong - just use what you get

## Platform
The first thing to decide is which platform to play on. Players on PC and mobile (Android & iOS) play together, whilst those on Playstation are on their own.

## Server
On PC and mobile there have already been numerous server merges. This means that the only thing that matters is which region you pick i.e. America, Europe. So no matter which server you pick, you'll play with everyone registered in that region.

For Playstation I'm not sure what the current state of server merges is, but I'd expect it to follow a similar path.

## Main character
One you start the game you'll have to choose your main character (MC) which will be male or female. The choice doesn't affect the story so choose what you prefer.

## Story progress
When starting out you'll want to get through most of the main story, using the glorious `Skip` button where needed. This will help unlock many areas of the map.

You can also join various groups and teleport to them to unlock more areas faster.

Unlocking areas can be useful for accessing areas with limited time events.

## Worlds (Starchart Overview)
As of version 4.2, there are 4 different Worlds (Starchart Overview). Each World has smaller sub areas which from the map view can be found "orbiting" the main World.

The Worlds in order of appearance are:
1. Aesperia
2. Vera
3. Domain 9
4. Network

## User Interface
It may sound silly to have a guide on the UI, but the menus are really something special in ToF that will confuse newcomers.

See a rundown of what to lookout for here: ...

## Weapons

## Gear

## Crew

## Mentor
There is a mentor system where someone can guide new players and both get rewards.
