# Weapons
In Tower of Fantasy you pull for the weapons, and the character models (AKA Simulacra) comes with it. The weapon and character each have their own name so it can be confusing at first.

# Rarity
SSR & SR are the equilvalent of 5* & 4* respectively in Hoyoverse games. No new SR were released after launch.

# Advancements
Advancements are when you have multiple copies of a weapon that you use to upgrade the power of your weapon further, in the same way that Hoyoverse games work with Constellations and Eidolons etc. Advancements go from A0 to A6.

# Matrices
