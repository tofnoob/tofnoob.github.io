# Dark Crystals
This is the main gacha currency, which is the equivalent to primogems in Genhin Impact. Use it to obtain limited weapons by converting it to red nucleus, as well as many other useful items that be found in the shop.

# How to obtain
- ToF codes
- Twitch drops
- Activity missions

## ToF codes
Codes often get released via the ToF discord channel "tof-codes". To redeem the code go to the `Rewards` menu, click on the `Rewards` tab then select `Exchange`. Here you can enter the code and you'll get the gift in your mailbox after a couple of minutes (this takes quite a bit longer than Hoyoverse games, so be patient).

You can also see codes posted by users on www.reddit.com/r/toweroffantasy

The ToF discord can be found at:

## Twitch drops
Major game releases often come with Twitch rewards if you watch participating streams for 30 minutes per day.
