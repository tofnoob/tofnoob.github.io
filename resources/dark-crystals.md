# Dark Crystals (DC)
This is the main gacha currency, which is the equivalent to primogems in Genhin Impact. Use it to obtain limited weapons by converting it to red nucleus, as well as many other useful items that be found in the shop.

# How to obtain
- [ToF codes](##tof-codes)
- [Twitch drops](##twitch-drops)
- [Daily login](##daily-login)
- [Themed event](##themed-event)

## ToF codes
Codes often get released via the ToF discord channel "tof-codes". To redeem the code go to the `Rewards` menu, click on the `Rewards` tab then select `Exchange`. Here you can enter the code and you'll get the gift in your mailbox after a couple of minutes (this takes quite a bit longer than Hoyoverse games, so be patient).

You can also see codes posted by users on www.reddit.com/r/toweroffantasy

The ToF discord can be found at:

## Twitch drops
Major game releases often come with Twitch rewards if you watch participating streams for 30 minutes per day.

## Daily Login
Similar to Hoyoverse games, there is actually a daily login where you get coins that can be exchanged for DC and other items.

## Themed Event
This appears once in a while, usually on major releases. It will have it's own `Themed Event` tab in the special event menu and will say `Journey of friendship`. Note that the `Go` button to actually enter the page often takes a few seconds to load.

To get the basic rewards you have to simply obtain 200 weekly activity points then you can claim a small amount of DC. This is easy to achieve by doing normal daily tasks so this is recommended.

For additional DC rewards you'll have to invite a certain amount of friends to the game by sharing an invitation code.
