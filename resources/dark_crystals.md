## ToF Codes
Codes often get released via the ToF discord channel "tof-codes". To redeem the code go to the `Rewards` menu, click on the `Rewards` tab then select `Exchange`. Here you can enter the code and you'll get the gift in your mailbox after a couple of minutes (this takes quite a bit longer than Hoyoverse games, so be patient).

You can also see codes posted by users on www.reddit.com/r/toweroffantasy

The ToF discord can be found at:

## ToF Competition
Once in a while you can find Twitter/X competitions to win a certain amount of DC by sharing and retweeting posts. A recent competition in 2024 had the first prize at **42,000** DC!!

These competitions usually appear in the Discord channel `discord-event-news`, which sometimes get re-posted on the ToF subreddit.

## Twitch Drops
Major game releases often come with Twitch rewards if you watch participating streams for 30 minutes per day. Create a free Twitch account and watch the stream for the target time each day to get free rewards such as DC, red nucleus and red vouchers! Here's a list of participating steams when drops are happening https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/tower-of-fantasy?filter=drops

You will see a Twitch notification when you are eligible to claim the reward, and you must press the `claim` button on that specific drop on Twitch. There will be a progress bar of how much you've watched in various places, but the best place to check is here https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory

Note that I'd recommend doing this on a PC, as doing this on mobile app seems to be fairly unreliable for me (Android). You will probably have to watch the stream a lot longer than you expect, and keep checking your progress on the inventory site given above.

Once you claim the Twitch reward then use the relevant link below to redeem and send it to your inbox

## Daily Login
Similar to Hoyoverse games, there is actually a daily login where you get coins that can be exchanged for DC and other items.

## Themed Event
This appears once in a while, usually on major releases. It will have it's own `Themed Event` tab in the special event menu and will say `Journey of friendship`. Note that the `Go` button to actually enter the page often takes a few seconds to load.

To get the basic rewards you have to simply obtain 200 weekly activity points then you can claim a small amount of DC. This is easy to achieve by doing normal daily tasks so this is recommended.

For additional DC rewards you'll have to invite a certain amount of friends to the game by sharing an invitation code.
