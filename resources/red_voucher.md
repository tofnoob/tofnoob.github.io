# Red Voucher
This is what you need to pull for the limited matrices, so use them wisely! You can exchange Dark Crystals to obtain these via the shop or by clicking on the 1x or 10x pull buttons on a banner.

The limited matrices that you get are another type of gear that can significantly boost the power of your weapons. They are also the biggest money sink in the game as you can be unlucky and find it hard to get exactly what you want by losing 50/50s and getting the wrong pieces. There are some ways to get better odds which will be discussed in the matrices section.
