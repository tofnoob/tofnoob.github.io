# Welcome
Welcome to my guide page for Tower of Fantasy!

If you are completely new to the game then [start here](https://tofnoob.github.io/new_player/new_player.html).

# Purpose
This site is intended as a quick guide and reference to all things Tower of Fantasy. Its built from version 4.2 onwards so if you're a returning player then there have been some changes which I'll list out soon.

## 4.2 event gift
Don't forget to pickup the Seaside Star for 1 gold which is a **DAILY** drop! It runs from August 13-31st!

You must scroll to the **very bottom** of the gift pack page to find it. This gives up to 150 DC if you're lucky.
